# Introduction

Hi, I'm Stefano Chen a master's degree student in Computer Engineering at the University of Trieste in Italy.\
This is an exam project for the Web Development 2024-2025 course.\
The technologies used in this project are:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

# How to run

Go to the [latest releases page](https://github.com/stefano-chen/NextBid/releases/latest) and click on `Assets` at the bottom to show the files available in the release.
Download the source code and extract it.\
The unzipped folder has the following structure:

```
.
├───/backend
│    ├───/database
│    │   └───/data    //This folder will be used to store MongoDB`s data persistently.
│    ├───/server
│    │
│    └───compose.yaml
│
├───/frontend
│
├───.gitignore
├───LICENSE
└───README.md
```

To run locally follow this steps:

1. Open a terminal inside the folder
2. Change the directory to backend

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Run Docker compose

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. Wait until you see this message on the console

   ```
   chen-server    | HTTP server running on port 3000
   ```

5. Now open a browser and type the following url in the address bar

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Note
In the current release (v1.0.3), the web app is not fully optimized for all screen sizes.\
We are actively working to improve responsiveness in an upcoming update. Thank you for your patience!

# Assignment

We want to create a web application that acts as an auction site.\
The application will allow a registered user to put items up for auction and bid on other's
items.\
It will be possible to search for auctions of interest.\
The items up for auction will have a current bid, a listing title, a description and an auction due date.\
Bids will be valid only if received before the auction due date. The highest bid at the end will win the auction.\
You will be able to see the history of each auction with the list of accepted
bids.\
There is not need to implement a payment management system.\
To signup, an user must provide an unique username, a name, surname and password.\
The password will be used to authenticate the user.

The project will consist of two parts:

1. The server side, where the data will be stored and the
   authentication/authorization is performed.
2. The client side that will interact with the server to display and manipulate the application data.

# Main Functionality

- **Listing all auctions**: You can view a list of all auctions, active or expired, and filtering with a search parameter.
- **Create a new auction**: An authenticated user can make a new listing for an auction.\
  The auction will contain: - Title - Description - Due Date - Starting Bid
- **View an auction details**: You will be able to see an auction detail, specially the current bid and the winning user.
- **Modify an auction**: The auction's owner can modify some information (Title and Description).
- **Delete an auction**: The auction's owner can delete the auction at any time.
- **New bid**: An authenticated user can make a new bid for an auction. The bid will be accepted only if greater than the current bid, otherwise we return an error. The bids received after the due date will not be considered.
- **Bid listing**: For each auction, the user can see all the bids
- **Bid details**: For each bid, the user can see all details
    - Who made it
    - When was made
    - The amount
- **Listing all users**: You can see the list of all users, and filtering with a search parameter. For each user you can see all the auctions won.
- **SignUp**: An user can signup by providing
    - username
    - password
    - name
    - surname
